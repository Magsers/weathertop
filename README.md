This is my version of WeatherTop 1000 Programming and Web Development, joint assignment.
I have deployed Release 3 so for the marking/payment scheme I'm aiming to be in
the Release 3 category.  

All features are working that were specified in the briefing.
* On launching the web application you are brought to the homepage 
where you have the option of logging in if you are already registered 
or signing up.
* You must have a unique email address in order to sign up.
You cannot leave any fields in the form blank also.  
* When you register your details are stored in the database.
* You are brought to your profile page on registering where you have the option to Add Stations.
* On adding a station you are asked for the latitude and longitude which only takes values between -90 and 90 for latitude
and -180 to 180 for longitude.
* When you add a Station you have the option to open the Station folder and add a Reading or delete the station.
* To add a reading you must select the code 100-800 from a dropdown menu, add the temperature in Centigrade which converts
it to Fahernheit on submission, add the WindSpeed ( 0-117) which gives you what it is equivalent to on the Beaufort Scale plus
the label it is called.  
* The wind direction ( 0" - 360") is inputted by the user to give the wind direction in words.
* The Windchill factor is calculated and displayed from the wind speed and temperature.
* The pressure is inputted and displayed. 
* Trend arrows appear, up, down or not at all if there is an increasing/decreasing trend in the last 3 readings for temperature
, wind speed and pressure.
* You can delete readings.
* If you select Dashboard you are brought back to your list of stations.  If you add more stations they will display in 
alphabetical order.
* If you add readings to the stations the latest conditions will display on cards on the dashboard and at the top of 
the screen in that station's folder.
* You cannot enter duplicate Station names.
* If you are looged in and you select About or Weathertop which brings you to the home screen you will stay logged in.
* If you go to your profile you can edit your name and password but not your email address.  
* On registering and in editing your details in profile it will check to see you have entered the same password twice.
* You can logout, close the application and log in again and your details will be saved.
